"""Turning a multiplex's tables into a channel list.

The tables each hold part of the answer. The PAT says which programmes exist, the SDT says what
they are called, the PMTs say what they are made of, and the NIT says what number a viewer types.
This module joins them up.

**A service in one table and not another is the normal case, not an error.** A multiplex is
reconfigured while it is on the air; a scan reads its tables over a second or two and can easily
catch an SDT from before a change and a PAT from after it. So the join is deliberately generous:
a service named in the SDT is listed even if no PMT for it arrived, and a programme in the PAT is
listed even if nothing named it. Dropping either would mean a channel disappearing from the list
for reasons the viewer cannot see.
