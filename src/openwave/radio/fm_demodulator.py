"""Recovering audio from an FM carrier.

The chain, from samples to sound:

1. **Shift** the wanted station to zero hertz. A window holds several stations; this picks one.
2. **Decimate** to a rate wide enough for the *modulated* signal, not merely for the multiplex
   inside it. See :data:`MPX_SAMPLE_RATE_HZ`: getting this wrong produces distortion that
   imitates a stereo pilot. Decimating also throws away most of the noise and all the
   neighbouring stations.
3. **Demodulate.** FM carries its information in how fast the phase turns, so the instantaneous
   frequency is the phase difference between consecutive samples. What comes out is the
   multiplex.
4. **Decode the multiplex.** Mono is the part below 15 kHz. Stereo adds a pilot at 19 kHz and
   the difference signal on a 38 kHz subcarrier, which has to be brought back down and
   recombined.
5. **De-emphasise.** Transmitters boost the treble before sending; receivers must undo it or
   the result is harsh and noisy.

Every function here is pure: arrays in, arrays out. The tests drive them with signals from
:mod:`openwave.radio.synthesis`, where the right answer is known in advance.
