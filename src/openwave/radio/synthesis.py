"""Synthetic FM broadcast signals.

This module generates FM transmissions that do not exist. It is not a toy: with no receiver
available to the maintainer, it is how every detector and demodulator in OpenWave is tested, and
how a test can state the answer in advance -- inject a stereo station at 98.0 MHz, 20 dB above
the noise, and assert that the scanner finds exactly that.

**How the phase is computed.** The stereo multiplex is built as a sum of sinusoids, which means
its integral has a closed form, which means the FM phase can be evaluated directly at any sample
index::

    m(t)  = sum over i of  a_i cos(2*pi*f_i*t + p_i)
    phi(t) = 2*pi*dev * integral of m  =  dev * sum of (a_i/f_i) sin(2*pi*f_i*t + p_i)

Two useful consequences follow. Successive reads are continuous in phase without carrying any
state, because sample index 5000 evaluates to the same thing whether it was reached in one read
or in five. And the output is exactly reproducible, because nothing accumulates.

**What it does not model.** A synthetic signal is clean in ways the air never is: no multipath,
no adjacent-channel splatter, no tuner nonlinearity, no drifting oscillator. Code that passes
against this module can still fail on a rooftop antenna, which is why ``hardware validation``
issues exist. See :doc:`/architecture`.
